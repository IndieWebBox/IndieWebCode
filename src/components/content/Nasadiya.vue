     <h1>Nasadiya Sukta</h1>
    <p>The Nāsadīya Sūkta (after the incipit ná ásat, or 'not the non-existent'), also known as the Hymn of Creation, is the 129th hymn of the 10th mandala of the Rigveda (10:129). It is concerned with cosmology and the origin of the universe.</p>
    <p>The Nāsadīya Sūkta has been the subject of extensive scholarly attention. There are numerous translations and interpretations of its profound and mysterious verses.</p>
    <p>Nasadiya Sukta begins with the statement: 'Then, there was neither existence, nor non-existence.' It ponders when, why, and through whom the universe came into being in a contemplative tone, and provides no definite answers. Rather, it concludes that the gods too may not know, as they came after creation, and that even the surveyor of that which has been created, in the highest heaven may or may not know.</p>
    <p>To this extent, the conventional English title Hymn of Creation is perhaps misleading, since the verse does not itself present a cosmogony or creation myth akin to those found in other religious texts, instead provoking the listener to question whether one can ever know ALL the details of origins of the universe.</p>
    <p><strong>Nasadiya Sukta (Hymn of non-Eternity, origin of universe):</strong></p>
    <p>There was neither non-existence nor existence then;<br>Neither the realm of space, nor the sky which is beyond;<br>What stirred? Where? In whose protection?</p>
    <p>There was neither death nor immortality then;<br>No distinguishing sign of night nor of day;<br>That One breathed, windless, by its own impulse;<br>Other than that there was nothing beyond.</p><p>Darkness there was at first, by darkness hidden;<br>Without distinctive marks, this all was water;<br>That which, becoming, by the void was covered;<br>That One by force of heat came into being;</p><p>Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it?<br>Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?<br>Gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.<br>Who then knows whence it has arisen?</p><p>Whether God's will created it, or whether He was mute;<br>Perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not;<br>The Supreme Brahman of the world, all pervasive and all knowing<br>He indeed knows, if not, no one knows</p><p>—Rigveda 10.129 (Abridged, Tr: Kramer / Christian)</p>
